CUCUMBER

Test Driven Development - it's a development approach when before starting actual development, we create tests that will verify functionality (method).
 Functionality will be verified over unit test. For unit test we can use TestNG or Junit. Both of them are unit testing frameworks.
Junit is a pure unit testing framework.
For example in repl.it almost all assignments use junit for verification.
Usually developers write unit tests for their code.
Unit testing is the lowest testing, and essential stage of development as well as code review.
Sometimes SDET also involved into unit testing.
But our focus is on functional testing with selenium webdriver.
You were doing TDD whenever you were working on repl.it tasks.
Every solution had to go though bunch of unit tests. Based on errors, you could understand how to fix your code.
BDD is a branch of TDD.
For implementing BDD we use Cucumber.
1-Go to intellij --> file --> new maven project
  group id: com.vytrack
   artifact id: Summer2019OnlineCucumberSelenium
   snapshot: default
 click next -->
  project name: Summer2019OnlineCucumberSelenium
   Enable auto import!
2- Then go to pom.xml file and add properties for java version:
    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
Ignore intellij update, update intellij when you will find a job
3- right click on test --> new directory named "resources"
resources use to store test data
4-then right click on resources --> new directory named "features"
features - it's a folder where we gonna store tests.
inside features folder we will create .feature files.
5- right click on java --> new package --> com.vytrack.pages
If your packages are not nested --> click on gear icon and unselect "Compact middle packages"
right click on com.vytrack --> new package:
    pages
    runners
    utilities
    step_definitions
If it's asking you for type of file, select .txt file for now.
Click shift twice and type plugins
Go to plugins and find Cucumber for java plugin and Gherkin.
Install this plugin and restart IDE
Make sure that you don't have Substep plugin. If you have it - delete it.
Your .feature files will be green.
