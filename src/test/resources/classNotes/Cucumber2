@smoke_test   --> automatically apllied to all steps
Feature: Smoke test

  Background: open login page and login as store manager
    Given user is on the login page
    Then user logs in as store manager

  Scenario: Verify dashboard page
    And user verifies that "Dashboard" page subtitle is displayed

  Scenario: Verify Manage Dashboards page
    And user navigates to "Dashboards" then to "Manage Dashboards"
    Then user verifies that "All Manage Dashboards" page subtitle is displayed

Background - it's a precondition for every test scenario in one particular feature file. Instead of repeating same test steps for every scenario, we can put these steps into background.

Flow of execution:

hook before --> background --> scenario --> hook after

hook and background are completely optional.

Make sure that you rename classes and any other files properly.

Tight click on file --> refactor --> rename

Provide new name and click refactor.

To run tests in headless mode, we can use few things:

HTMLUnit
PhantomJS
Firefox with FirefoxOptions that will set headless mode to true
Chrome with ChromeOptions,  where we will set headless mode to true:

  				case "chrome_headless":
                    WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
                    //to configure chrome browser for tests
                    ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
                    //to run tests without interface, set to true
                    options.setHeadless(true);
                    driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
                    break;


Headless webdriver is much faster, because it doesn't display web page, tests are running in a background.

Headless webdriver cannot upload files. This is a disadvantage of running tests in headless browser.

You can still tale screenshots and do almost everything like with regular browser.


Common issue in cucumber: step definitions with same name.

This is maven build.

Verify it's a maven goal.

verify - it's one of the phases from maven life-cycle.

life cycle starts from compiling project and ends with deployment.

To generate report, you must execute maven goal verify.

Report will not be generated if you runt it from CucumberRunner directly.

maven-cucumber-reporting plugin requires .json file, to create report.

We need declare in runner class json report:

"json:target/cucumber.json"

Also, we can run verify command from terminal:

mvn verify |  but you need to install maven to use it.

We will do it later.

if(scenario.isFailed()){
            System.out.println("Test failed!");
            byte[] screenshot = ((TakesScreenshot)Driver.get()).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES);
            scenario.embed(screenshot, "image/png");
}

Take a screenshot, only if scenario fails.

scenario.embed(screenshot, "image/png", "name of screenshot");
