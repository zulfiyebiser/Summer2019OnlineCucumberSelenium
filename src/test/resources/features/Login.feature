#  Any step that was implemented before, can be reused
#  If test step has yellow background, tat means it doesn't have implementation yet
#  click command/ctrl + option/alt + L to organize code, save like in java
#  I had somewhere from 2 to 25 scenarios in every feature file
#  By passing parameters/strings in "some word" we can reuse test steps
#  In my project, I was trying to keep scenarios short
